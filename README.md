# KGR4VRD: Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Visual Relationship Detection

## KGR4VRD
The KGR4VRD repository hosts code associated with aspects of our neurosymbolic AI research. This research explores combining symbolic reasoning with deep (subsymbolic) learning in neurosymbolic systems directed at the computer vision task of detecting visual relationships in images.

The code hosted here is associated with the (forthcoming) paper:
> **Herron, D., Jimenez-Ruiz, E., Weyde, T.** (2026). `Logical Reasoning with OWL Knowledge Graphs for Learning and Validating Visual Relationship Detection.` (under review)


## NeSy4VRD

The acronym NeSy4VRD stands for "Neurosymbolic AI for Visual Relationship Detection". NeSy4VRD is a unique `image dataset plus OWL ontology' resource that we created.
